# PegasBusinessCard

## Description: 
Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business: a favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

## Requirements:
The design had to include:
  * Business name
  * At least one photo representing the business
  * Two or more other pieces of information, such as:
    * Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website) 
    * Address of the Business
    * Description of business
    * Hours of operation

Implemented intents for the contact info and ViewPagerAdapter in order to display a slider with 7 images, although it was not required. It was not required but I actually contacted an actual local business (Pegas Bycicles) and obtained their consent to build an app for them. They were super nice and sent me all the photos I requested in high-definition. <3 I was so proud of my result - I was able to implement some features way ahead before learning about them.
